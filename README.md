## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kuttesch/WebMerge.git
cd webmerge
````

## Usage

WebMerge is a command-line tool that takes four arguments: the source HTML file, the source CSS file, the source JavaScript file, and the output file.

Here's an example of how to use it:
```Bash
python webmerge.py D:/Folder/src/index.html D:/Folder/src/styles.css D:/Folder/src/script.js D:/Folder/prod/prod.html
````
In this example:

- `D:/Folder/src/index.html` is the path to the source HTML file.
- `D:/Folder/src/styles.css` is the path to the source CSS file.
- `D:/Folder/src/script.js` is the path to the source JavaScript file.
- `D:/Folder/prod/prod.html` is the path where the output file will be created.

The tool reads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, merges them into a single HTML file, and writes the result to the output file.
